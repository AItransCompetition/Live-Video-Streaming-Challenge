# Live-Video-Streaming-Challenge
Live video streaming meets many new challenges compared to on-demand streaming of pre-recorded video. For example, it requires a low end-to-end latency for real-time interaction between the broadcaster and the viewers, while still maintaining few rebuffering events and high video quality. To deliver high quality video across diverse network conditions, most Internet video delivery uses adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms, combined with HTTP chunk-based streaming protocols. However, the state-of-art ABR algorithms are proposed for VoD and they do not perform well on Live Broadcast. Therefore, we would like to encourage the multimedia systems community to take on the challenge of designing ABR algorithms for live video broadcasts scenarios that would lead better superior quality of experience (QoE) compared to the state-of-the-art. On our simulator platform, given video trace and network trace, the main task is to design an ABR algorithm to optimize our multi-objective QoE.
